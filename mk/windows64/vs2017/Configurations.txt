Configuration in Visual Studio must be left as "Release", otherwise it won't compile,
but one can still use debugging options by making the following changes in the project properties:

Debug:

	Optimization=Disabled
	Inline Function Expansion: Disabled
	Enable Intrinsic Functions: No
	Favor Size Or Speed: Neither
	Preprocessor: DEBUG instead of NDEBUG
	Code Generation->Basic Runtime Checks: Both
	
Release:

	Optimization=Full
	Inline Function Expansion: Any Suitable
	Enable Intrinsic Functions: Yes
	Favor Size Or Speed: Favor fast code
	Preprocessor: NDEBUG instead of DEBUG
	Code Generation->Basic Runtime Checks: Default
