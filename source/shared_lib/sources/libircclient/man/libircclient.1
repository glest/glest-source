.SS Known issues
.sp
Even though possible by using multiple sessions, the library is not suitable to connect to a large number of IRC servers simultaneously. If you still want to use it, you\(aqd have to overcome the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
You cannot use the main loop in \fBirc_run()\fP because it only supports one session. You would have to use \fBirc_add_select_descriptors()\fP
.IP \(bu 2
You\(aqd have to handle reconnections separately by processing the relevant \fBirc_process_select_descriptors()\fP return values
.IP \(bu 2
If you wish to use poll/epoll() instead of select() you\(aqd have to write more logic as it is not directly supported. See the \fIFAQ\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
The library is not optimized to have a low per\-connection memory footprint, each non\-SSL connection uses at least 4K, with around 32K per connection for SSL.

.SS Author
.sp
This library is created by George Yunaev, copyright 2004\-2016. Please see \fI\%http://www.ulduzsoft.com/linux/libircclient\fP
.SS License

.SH INTEGRATION
.SS Integration
.SS Requirements
.SS Supported operating systems and compilers
.sp
The library has been extensively tested on Linux x86 and x86_64. It has also been tested on Solaris x86, Linux on ARM and Linux on MIPS platforms, on Mac OS X on x86 and on various versions of Microsoft Windows.
.SS Compilation
.sp
On Linux, FreeBSD and Mac OS X the library has to be compiled and installed before use unless you use a precompiled package provided by your operating system distribution. If it is provided, you are recommended to use it as it would be updated
from the central repository when the bugs are fixed.
.sp
On Microsoft Windows the official library binaries are provided, so you do not have to build it. Unless you have experience building with Cygwin, you\(aqre advised not to build from source and use the official binary.
.SS Required libraries
.sp
The library depends only on libc (glibc\-devel on Linux) and gcc, although the examples require also libstdc++ (libstdc++\-devel) and g++. Minimum supported version is glibc 2.2,
although if IPv6 is requested, at least glibc 2.4 is required.
.sp
If the library is built with SSL support, the openssl development package (openssl\-devel) needs to be installed.
.sp
On Microsoft Windows the Cygwin with necessary development packages must be installed (and openssl\-devel as well).
.SS Compiling
.sp
The library is configured and built the standard Unix way:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\&./configure [\-\-enable\-openssl] [\-\-enable\-ipv6]
make
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Installing
.sp
Although no install is necessary to use the libraries, the install target is provided for convenience and could be invoked via \fBsudo make install\fP
.SS Linking
.sp
Link your application with either libircclient.a or libircclient.so depending on your needs. If you use the system\-provided library, please link with libircclient.so.
.sp
If you have built the library with SSL support, you will need to link with OpenSSL libraries; add \fB\-lcrypto \-lssl\fP to your LDFLAGS
.sp
On Microsoft Windows please link with libircclient.lib which implicitly links with libircclient.dll
.SS Coding
.SS Initialization
.SS Include the headers
.sp
Before using the library you need to include the library header \fIlibircclient.h\fP\&. You may also want to include \fIlibirc_rfcnumeric.h\fP which provides the RFC codes:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
#include "libircclient.h"
#include "libirc_rfcnumeric.h"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Create event handlers
.sp
Unlike most network protocols such as HTTP or SMTP, the IRC protocol is event\-based. The events come from server asynchronously. Some events are triggered by your
action (such as joining the channel or changing your nick), some are triggered by other IRC users (such as sending you a message), and some are triggered by the IRC
server itself (such as sending operation notes or invoking NickServ services).
.sp
Libircclient helps handling those events by providing the \fBevent handling structure\fP\&. It declares the events you can define in your application,
and when such event is received from the server, the appropriate callback will be called. The number of events you need to handle depending on the complexity of your client
and the functionality it supports.
.sp
Generally there are only two events you must handle to provide a bare minimum functionality: \fBevent_connect\fP and \fBevent_numeric\fP\&. However it is recommended
to create an event dump function and use it for all unused events to make sure you do not miss an important event because you expected a wrong one. See function \fBdump_event\fP in
the file examples/irctest.c
.SS Windows\-specific initialization
.sp
If you link with the \fBstatic\fP library on Microsoft Windows, you need to initialize the Winsock2 library before calling the library functions. It could be done by following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
WSADATA wsaData;

if ( WSAStartup ( MAKEWORD (2, 2), &wsaData) != 0 )
    // report an error
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
However if you link with the \fBdynamic\fP library (libircclient.dll) which is default if you use the official build, this is not needed because the DLL initializes it automatically on load.
.SS Create an IRC session
.sp
To use the library at least one \fBIRC session\fP needs to be created. One session could be used to establish a single connection to one IRC server for one nick.
However more than one session could be created if needed.
.sp
To create a session, call the \fBirc_create_session()\fP function:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
// The IRC callbacks structure
irc_callbacks_t callbacks;

// Init it
memset ( &callbacks, 0, sizeof(callbacks) );

// Set up the mandatory events
callbacks.event_connect = event_connect;
callbacks.event_numeric = event_numeric;

// Set up the rest of events

// Now create the session
irc_session_t * session = irc_create_session( &callbacks );

if ( !session )
    // Handle the error
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This code could be repeated as many times as needed to create multiple sessions. The same callback structure could be reused for multiple sessions.
.SS Set options
.sp
Besides debugging there are two options you may need to use. The \fBLIBIRC_OPTION_STRIPNICKS\fP enables automatic parsing of nicknames,
and since it is hard to imagine the case when it should not be enabled, we enable it:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
irc_option_set( session, LIBIRC_OPTION_STRIPNICKS );
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The second option you may need if you use SSL connections and plan to connect to the servers which use self\-signed certificates. See the
documentation for \fBLIBIRC_OPTION_SSL_NO_VERIFY\fP
.SS Connect to the server
.sp
To initiate the connection to the IRC server, call the \fBirc_connect()\fP function:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
// Connect to a regular IRC server
if ( irc_connect (session, "irc.example.com", 6667, 0, "mynick", "myusername", "myrealname" ) )
  // Handle the error: irc_strerror() and irc_errno()
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To initiate the connection to the IRC server over SSL, call the \fBirc_connect()\fP function and prefix the host name or IP address with a hash symbol:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
// Connect to the SSL server; #192.168.1.1 is also possible
if ( irc_connect (session, "#irc.example.com", 6669, 0, "mynick", "myusername", "myrealname" ) )
  // Handle the error: irc_strerror() and irc_errno()
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This function only initiates the connection, so when it successfully returns the connection is only initiated, but not established yet. Then one
of the following happens after you invoke the networking handler:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If the connection is established, you will receive the \fBevent_connect\fP \- this is why it is important to handle it
.IP \(bu 2
If the connection failed, the networking handler function will return failure
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Connect to the IPv6 server
.sp
To initiate the connection to the IPv6 server, call the \fBirc_connect6()\fP function:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
if ( irc_connect6 (session, "2001:0db8:85a3:0042:1000:8a2e:0370:7334", 6669, 0, "mynick", "myusername", "myrealname" ) )
  // Handle the error: irc_strerror() and irc_errno()
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The rest of the details, including the return value and the SSL are the same as with regular connect.
.SS Start the networking loop
.sp
To let the library handle the events, there are two scenarios. You can either invoke the built\-in networking loop which will handle the networking and
call your events, or you can write your own loop.
.sp
Invoking the build\-in networking loop is simpler but limited. Since it loops until the connection terminates, it is not an option for a GUI application
(unless you start the loop in a separate thread which you can do). And since this loop only can handle one session, it is impossible to use it if you want
to handle multiple IRC sessions. In those cases the custom networking loop, described below, should be used.
.sp
To start the event loop call the \fBirc_run()\fP function:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
if ( irc_run (s) )
  // Either the connection to the server could not be established or terminated. See irc_errno()
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Remember that irc_run() call \fBwill not return\fP until the server connection is not active anymore.
.SS Use the custom networking loop
.sp
If you use multiple sessions or have your own socket handler, you can use the custom networking loop. In this case your application must be select()\-based
(\fIsee the FAQ\fP if you want to use other polling methods). And you need to run the following loop:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
// Make sure that all the IRC sessions are connected
if ( !irc_is_connected(session) )
  // reconnect it, or abort

// Create the structures for select()
struct timeval tv;
fd_set in_set, out_set;
int maxfd = 0;

// Wait 0.25 sec for the events \- you can wait longer if you want to, but the library has internal timeouts
// so it needs to be called periodically even if there are no network events
tv.tv_usec = 250000;
tv.tv_sec = 0;

// Initialize the sets
FD_ZERO (&in_set);
FD_ZERO (&out_set);

// Add your own descriptors you need to wait for, if any
\&...

// Add the IRC session descriptors \- call irc_add_select_descriptors() for each active session
irc_add_select_descriptors( session, &in_set, &out_set, &maxfd );

// Call select()
if ( select (maxfd + 1, &in_set, &out_set, 0, &tv) < 0 )
   // Error

// You may also check if any descriptor is active, but again the library needs to handle internal timeouts,
// so you need to call irc_process_select_descriptors() for each session at least once in a few seconds
\&...

// Call irc_process_select_descriptors() for each session with the descriptor set
if ( irc_process_select_descriptors (session, &in_set, &out_set) )
    // The connection failed, or the server disconnected. Handle it.

// Do it again
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Channels and users
.sp
Before calling any of those functions make sure you have connected to the server.
.SS Join and leave a channel
.sp
To join the channel call the \fBirc_cmd_join()\fP function with the channel name:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
// Join the channel #linux
if ( irc_cmd_join( session, "#linux", 0 ) )
  // most likely connection error

// Join the channel $science protected by the secret key *superpassword*
if ( irc_cmd_join( session, "$science", "superpassword" ) )
  // most likely connection error
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can join as many channels as you want, although the serer may restrict the number of channels you can join simultaneously.
.sp
If the join was successful you will receive the \fBevent_join\fP event. You need to wait for this event before you can perform any channel operations (such as sending the messages). However you do NOT
have to wait for this event to issue a second JOIN command as shown in the example above.
.sp
If the join was not successful, you will receive the error via \fBevent_numeric\fP\&.
.sp
To leave the channel call the \fBirc_cmd_part()\fP function with the channel name:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
// Leave the channel #linux
if ( irc_cmd_part( session, "#linux" ) )
  // most likely connection error

// Leave the channel $science
if ( irc_cmd_part( session, "$science" ) )
  // most likely connection error
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Send a message to a channel or to a user
.sp
After you have joined the channel, you can send a message to the channel by using the \fBirc_cmd_msg()\fP function with the channel name:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
// Say "Hi!" to everyone in the channel #linux
if ( irc_cmd_msg( session, "#linux", "Hi!" ) )
  // most likely connection error
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Technically the protocol does not require one to join the channel to send the messages into the channel. However most servers by default set
the channel mode which prevents the users who did not join the channel from sending the message into the channel.
.sp
Same function is used to send a "private" message to another user. The "private" messages do not go through the channels, but they still go through
the IRC server (sometime multiple servers) and can be seen or even logged by the IRC network operators.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
// Say "Hi!" to IRC user john
if ( irc_cmd_msg( session, "john", "Hi!" ) )
  // most likely connection error
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the message was sent successfully you will not receive any confirmation or event. You will only receive the error via \fBevent_numeric\fP
if the message was not sent.
.SS Receive messages from a channel or from a user
.sp
You receive the channel messages by handling the \fBevent_channel\fP\&. Each time someone says something in the channel this event is called.
.sp
You receive the "private" messages from other users by handling the \fBevent_privmsg\fP\&.
.sp
Those event handlers should be created in your application and passed to the library when you \fI\%create an IRC session\fP
.SS Send an action message
.sp
"Action" messages, also called /me messages, are specially formatted CTCP messages. However the library contains a special function to send
them, \fBirc_cmd_me()\fP\&. Actions sent by other people are handled by the \fBevent_ctcp_action\fP event.
.sp
Same as with sending messages no confirmation is received on success.
.SS Send a CTCP request
.sp
Other CTCP requests such as PING, VERSION etc should be sent by calling \fBirc_cmd_ctcp_request()\fP\&. If the CTCP response is received,
it is handled by the \fBevent_ctcp_rep\fP event.
.SS Handling DCC chat
.SS Implementing the DCC callback
.sp
No matter whether you plan to initiate DCC chats or respond to them you must implement the \fBDCC callback\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
void dcc_callback (irc_session_t * session, irc_dcc_t id, int status, void * ctx, const char * data, unsigned int length)
{
   if ( status )
   {
       // If status is LIBIRC_ERR_CLOSED, the chat has been closed by the remote party.
       // Otherwise it is an error; the CHAT either terminated or could not be established. status is the error code; see irc_strerror(status)
   }
   else if ( length == 0 )
   {
       // The remote side has accepted the chat request, send "hello" something to them
       irc_dcc_text( session, id, "Hello!" );
   }
   else
   {
       // We have received the chat message from the remote party
       printf ("Remote party said: %s\en", data );
   }
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This callback should be passed to either \fBirc_dcc_chat()\fP function which initiates the request, or to \fBirc_dcc_accept()\fP function
which accepts the DCC CHAT request initiated by another user.
.SS Initiating the DCC CHAT
.sp
You can initiate the DCC chat with another user by calling \fBirc_dcc_chat()\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
// The DCC chat session id will be returned in this variable
irc_dcc_t dccid;

// Initiate the DCC chat with the IRC user "john"
if ( irc_dcc_chat( session, 0, "john", dcc_callback, &dccid ) )
  // report error
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now you can proceed with other tasks. When John accepts or declines the chat, the dcc_callback() will be called, and it will be possible
to use the \fBirc_dcc_text()\fP function to send the chat messages. The callback will also be called each time a new chat message is
received, or when the chat is finished or terminated because of network error.
.SS Responding to DCC CHAT requests
.sp
To respond to the DCC CHAT equests your application should implement for the \fBevent_dcc_chat_req\fP event.
The callback could be implemented as following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
void callback_event_dcc_chat( irc_session_t * session, const char * nick, const char * addr, irc_dcc_t dccid )
{
    // User \(aqnick\(aq from the IP address \(aqaddr\(aq tries to initiate the DCC chat with us.
    // Store this information in the application internal queue together with the dccid so the callback can return
    dcc_queue.store( dccid, "CHAT from " + nick + " IP address: " + addr  );
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
and registered when the IRC session is created.
If your application does not handle DCC at all you can just call the \fBirc_dcc_decline()\fP function inside the callback.
.sp
If it does, we only store this information in the callback, and return. This is because the event processing will stop
until the callback returns, so popping up the dialog asking for the user confirmation would stop further events such as
channel messages from being processed. Even if your application is automatic and doesn\(aqt pop up dialogs it is still better to
separate the chat logic from the callback logic.
.sp
Somewhere later the application would check the queue in the GUI thread, get this information, and pop up the dialog asking the user
feedback. Then if the chat request was accepted, the application would call the \fBirc_dcc_accept()\fP function, and if it was
declined, the application would call the \fBirc_dcc_decline()\fP function. Both functions will accept the \fIdccid\fP which identifies
this specific request:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
// Somewhere in the GUI thread
if ( !dcc_queue.empty() )
{
    // Get the DCC information and show the dialog to the user
    irc_dcc_t dccid = dcc_chat_queue.top().dccid;

    ...

    // React to the user entry
    if ( dialog.isAccepted() )
        irc_dcc_accept( session, dccid, 0, dcc_callback );
    else
        irc_dcc_decline( session, dccid );
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Send CHAT messages
.sp
Once the chat session is established, you can send the chat messages using \fBirc_dcc_text()\fP function. Note that you need to pass the
dcc session id instead of nick:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
irc_dcc_text( session, dccid, "Hello there!" );
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Handling DCC file transfer
.sp
This section covers handling sending and receiving files via DCC.
.SS Implementing the callback
.sp
No matter whether you plan to send or receive files via dcc you must implement the \fBDCC callback\fP\&.
While the same callback may be used both for sending and receiving, this is not recommended since the logic is different. Therefore
the suggested implementation would be to use different callbacks as suggested:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
// This callback is used when we send a file to the remote party
void callback_dcc_send_file (irc_session_t * session, irc_dcc_t id, int status, void * ctx, const char * data, unsigned int length)
{
   if ( status )
   {
       // It is an error; the send operation was either terminated or the connection could not be established. status is the error code; see irc_strerror(status)
   }
   else
   {
       // We have sent some data to the remote party, \(aqlength\(aq indicates how much data was sent
       printf ("Sent bytes: %d\en", length );
   }
}

// This callback is used when we receive a file from the remote party
void callback_dcc_recv_file (irc_session_t * session, irc_dcc_t id, int status, void * ctx, const char * data, unsigned int length)
{
   if ( status )
   {
       // It is an error; the send operation was either terminated or the connection could not be established. status is the error code; see irc_strerror(status)
   }
   else if ( data == 0 )
   {
       // File transfer has been finished
       printf ("File has been received successfully\en" );
   }
   else
   {
       // More file content has been received. Store it in memory, write to disk or something
       printf ("Received %d bytes of data\en", length );
   }
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This callback should be passed to either \fBirc_dcc_sendfile()\fP function which initiates the request, or to \fBirc_dcc_accept()\fP function
which accepts the DCC RECVFILE request initiated by another user.
.SS Sending the file via DCC
.sp
You can initiate sending the file via DCC to another user by calling \fBirc_dcc_sendfile()\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
// The DCC session id will be returned in this variable
irc_dcc_t dccid;

// Initiate sending of file "/etc/passwd" via DCC chat to the IRC user "john"
if ( irc_dcc_sendfile( session, 0, "john", "/etc/passwd", callback_dcc_send_file, &dccid ) )
  // report error
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now you can proceed with other tasks. When John accepts the request, the file will be sent and callback_dcc_send_file() will be called
each time a piece of file is sent. The callback will also be called when the file has been sent, or when sending was terminated
because of network error.
.SS Receive a file via DCC
.sp
To receive the file via DCC a remote user must initiate the DCC request to send you a file. To receive this request your application
should implement the \fBevent_dcc_send_req\fP event. The callback could be implemented as following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
void callback_event_dcc_file( irc_session_t * session, const char * nick, const char * addr, const char * filename, unsigned long size, irc_dcc_t dccid )
{
    // User \(aqnick\(aq from the IP address \(aqaddr\(aq tries to initiate the DCC chat with us.
    // Store this information in the application internal queue together with the dccid so the callback can return
    dcc_queue.store( dccid, "CHAT from " + nick + " IP address: " + addr + ", filename " + filename  );
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If your application does not handle DCC at all you can just call the \fBirc_dcc_decline()\fP function inside the callback.
.sp
If it does, we only store this information in the callback, and return. This is because the event processing will stop
until the callback returns, so popping up the dialog asking for the user confirmation would stop further events such as
channel messages from being processed. Even if your application is automatic and doesn\(aqt pop up dialogs it is still better to
separate the chat logic from the callback logic.
.sp
Somewhere later the application would check the queue in the GUI thread, get this information, and pop up the dialog asking the user
feedback. Then if the chat request was accepted, the application would call the \fBirc_dcc_accept()\fP function, and if it was
declined, the application would call the \fBirc_dcc_decline()\fP function. Both functions will accept the \fIdccid\fP which identifies
this specific request:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
// Somewhere in the GUI thread
if ( !dcc_queue.empty() )
{
    // Get the DCC information and show the dialog to the user
    irc_dcc_t dccid = dcc_chat_queue.top().dccid;

    ...

    // React to the user entry
    if ( dialog.isAccepted() )
        irc_dcc_accept( session, dccid, 0, dcc_callback );
    else
        irc_dcc_decline( session, dccid );
}

Note that it is not possible to request a remote user to send you a file.
.SS Handling colors
.SS Stripping colors from the message
.sp
If your bot reacts on the text messages, you need to strip down the colors from the text messages before processing them. Otherwise the user sending
the colored message won\(aqt get the same reaction as the user who doesn\(aqt use colors, and some users use colors by default.
.sp
Use the \fBirc_color_strip_from_mirc()\fP function to strip the ANSI colors from the text message. It does not modify the message which doesn\(aqt use colors.
.SS Color conversion
.sp
The library supports color translation, and can convert colors between the ANSI colors used by the IRC clients and their textual representation.
Colors usage is typically limited to the messages and user specified reasons. You cannot use colors as part of your nick or channel name.
.sp
Use the \fBirc_color_convert_from_mirc()\fP function to convert colors from ANSI to the library textual representation, and \fBirc_color_convert_to_mirc()\fP
to convert the library textual representation of colors into ANSI.
.sp
Do not forget to free() the returned pointer once it is not used anymore.
.SS Miscellaneous
.SS Tracking user nicks
.sp
If your application maintains some user\-specific quotas, it is important to track the nick changes. Since the nick is the only identifier
available to you, each time the user changes the nick you need to update your quota database. To do so you need to intercept the \fBevent_nick\fP
event. See the examples/censor.c for details.

\fBDescription:\fP
.sp
Every IRC event generates a callback. This type of callback is universal and is used by almost all IRC events. Depending on the event nature, it can have zero or more parameters.
For each type of event, the number of provided parameters is fixed, and their meaning is described in the \fBirc_callbacks_t\fP structure.
.sp
Every event has an origin (i.e. who originated the event). In some cases the \fIorigin\fP variable may be NULL, which indicates that event origin is unknown. The origin usually looks like \fInick!host@ircserver\fP,
i.e. like \fItim!home@irc.server.net\fP\&. Such origins can not be used in IRC commands, and need to be stripped (i.e. host and server part should be cut off) before using. This can be done either manually, by
calling \fBirc_target_get_nick()\fP, or automatically for all the events \- by setting the \fBLIBIRC_OPTION_STRIPNICKS\fP option with \fBirc_option_set()\fP\&.

This function initiates the connection to the IPv4 (irc_connect) or IPv6 (irc_connect6) IRC server. The server could be specified either by an IP address or by the DNS name.
The irc_connect6 works only if the library was built with the IPv6 support.
.sp
If the library was built with the OpenSSL support, and the IP address or the host name is prefixed by a hash, such as \fB"#irc.example.com"\fP, the library attempts to establish the SSL connection.
.sp
The connection is established asynchronously, and the \fBevent_connect\fP is called once the connection is established.

Note that to JOIN the password\-protected channel, you must know the password, and specify it in the key argument.
If join is successful, the \fBevent_join\fP will be called (with your nick as the origin), then typically the \fBevent_topic\fP is be called and then you
receive the list of users who are on the channel (by using LIBIRC_RFC_RPL_NAMREPLY), which will include the user who just joined.

Channel mode is represended by the multiple letters combination. Every letter has its own meaning in channel modes. Most channel mode letters
are boolean (i.e. could only be set or reset), but a few channel mode letters accept a parameter. All channel options are set by adding a
plus sign before the letter, and reset by adding a minus sign before the letter.

Describes the event callbacks structure which is used in registering the callbacks.
.sp
All the communication with the IRC network is based on events. Generally speaking, event is anything generated by someone else in the network, or by the IRC server itself.
"Someone sends you a message", "Someone has joined the channel", "Someone has quits IRC" \- all these messages are events.
.sp
Every event has its own event handler, which is called when the appropriate event is received.
You don\(aqt have to define all the event handlers; define only the handlers for the events you need to intercept, and set the remaining handler pointers to NULL.

If you need to handle more types of the message, define this event handler,  and check the source code of \fBlibirc_event_ctcp_internal\fP function to see how to write your own CTCP request handler.

This section describes contstants such as options and the error codes.
.SS Errors
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B LIBIRC_ERR_OK
.UNINDENT
.sp
(0): No error
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B LIBIRC_ERR_INVAL
.UNINDENT
.sp
(1): An invalid value was given for one of the arguments to a function. For example, supplying the NULL value as a channel argument of \fBirc_cmd_join()\fP produces this error.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B LIBIRC_ERR_RESOLV
.UNINDENT
.sp
(2): The host name supplied for \fBirc_connect()\fP function could not be resolved into valid IP address.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B LIBIRC_ERR_SOCKET
.UNINDENT
.sp
(3): The new socket could not be created or made non\-blocking. Usually means that the server is out of resources, or (hopefully not) a bug in libircclient. See also \fIfaq_err_socket\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B LIBIRC_ERR_CONNECT
.UNINDENT
.sp
(4): The socket could not connect to the IRC server, or to the destination DCC part. Usually means that either the IRC server is down or its address is invalid.
For DCC the reason usually is the firewall on your or destination computer, which refuses DCC transfer.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B LIBIRC_ERR_CLOSED
.UNINDENT
.sp
(5): The IRC connection was closed by the IRC server (which could mean that an IRC operator just have banned you from the server \- test your client before connecting to a public server), or the DCC connection
was closed by remote peer \- for example, the other side just terminates the IRC application.  Usually it is not an error.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B LIBIRC_ERR_NOMEM
.UNINDENT
.sp
(6): There are two possible reasons for this error. First is that memory could not be allocated for libircclient internal use, and this error is usually fatal.
Second reason is that the command buffer (which queues the commands ready to be sent to the IRC server) is full, and could not accept more commands yet.
In the last case you should just wait, and repeat the command later.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B LIBIRC_ERR_ACCEPT
.UNINDENT
.sp
(7): A DCC chat/send connection from the remote peer could not be accepted. Either the connection was just terminated before it is accepted, or there is a bug in libircclient.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B LIBIRC_ERR_NODCCSEND
.UNINDENT
.sp
(9):  A filename supplied to \fBirc_dcc_sendfile()\fP could not be sent. Either is is not a regular file (a directory or a socket, for example), or it could not be read. See also \fBLIBIRC_ERR_OPENFILE\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B LIBIRC_ERR_READ
.UNINDENT
.sp
(10): Either a DCC file could not be read (for example, was truncated during sending), or a DCC socket returns a read error, which usually means that the network connection is terminated.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B LIBIRC_ERR_WRITE
.UNINDENT
.sp
(11):  Either a DCC file could not be written (for example, there is no free space on disk), or a DCC socket returns a write error, which usually means that the network connection is terminated.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B LIBIRC_ERR_STATE
.UNINDENT
.sp
(12):  The function is called when it is not allowed to be called. For example, \fBirc_cmd_join()\fP was called before the connection to IRC server succeed, and \fBevent_connect\fP is called.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B LIBIRC_ERR_TIMEOUT
.UNINDENT
.sp
(13):  The DCC request is timed out. There is a timer for each DCC request, which tracks connecting, accepting  and non\-accepted/declined DCC requests. For every request this timer
is currently set to 60 seconds. If the DCC request was not connected, accepted or declined during this time, it will be terminated with this error.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B LIBIRC_ERR_OPENFILE
.UNINDENT
.sp
(14): The file specified in \fBirc_dcc_sendfile()\fP could not be opened.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B LIBIRC_ERR_TERMINATED
.UNINDENT
.sp
(15): The connection to the IRC server was terminated.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B LIBIRC_ERR_NOIPV6
.UNINDENT
.sp
(16): The function which requires IPv6 support was called, but the IPv6 support was not compiled into the application
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B LIBIRC_ERR_SSL_NOT_SUPPORTED
.UNINDENT
.sp
(17): The SSL connection was required but the library was not compiled with SSL support
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B LIBIRC_ERR_SSL_INIT_FAILED
.UNINDENT
.sp
(18): The SSL library could not be initialized.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B LIBIRC_ERR_CONNECT_SSL_FAILED
.UNINDENT
.sp
(19): SSL handshare failed when attempting to connect to the server. Typically this means you\(aqre trying to use SSL but attempting to connect to a non\-SSL port.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B LIBIRC_ERR_SSL_CERT_VERIFY_FAILED
.UNINDENT
.sp
(20): The server is using an invalid or the self\-signed certificate. Use \fBLIBIRC_OPTION_SSL_NO_VERIFY\fP option to connect to it.
.SS Options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B LIBIRC_OPTION_DEBUG
.UNINDENT
.sp
If set, enables additional debug output which goes to STDOUT.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B LIBIRC_OPTION_STRIPNICKS
.UNINDENT
.sp
If set, strips the event origins automatically. Every event has an origin (i.e. who originated the event). The origin usually looks like \fInick!host@ircserver\fP,
i.e. like \fItim!home@irc.server.net\fP\&. Such origins can not be used in IRC commands, and need to be stripped (i.e. host and server part should be cut off) before using.
This can be done either manually by calling \fBirc_target_get_nick()\fP, or automatically for all the events if this option is set.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B LIBIRC_OPTION_SSL_NO_VERIFY
.UNINDENT
.sp
By default the SSL connection is authenticated by verifying that the certificate presented by the server is signed by a known trusted certificate authority.
Since those typically cost money, some IRC servers use the self\-signed certificates. They provide the benefits of the SSL connection but since they are
not signed by the Certificate Authority, their authencity cannot be verified. This option, if set, disables the certificate verification \- the library
will accept any certificate presented by the server.
.sp
This option must be set before the \fBirc_connect\fP function is called.
.SH APPENDIX
.SS Frequently asked questions
.SS Why do I get a LIBIRC_ERR_SOCKET error under Win32 when using a static library?
.sp
Because on Win32 you have to initialize the Winsock API before using it:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
WSADATA wsaData;

if ( WSAStartup ( MAKEWORD (2, 2), &wsaData) != 0 )
    // report an error

// Now you can use libircclient
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You have to do it ONCE in your application, and since libircclient does not know whether you already initialized it or not, it does not contain any Winsock initialization code.
.SS What does it mean that the IRC protocol is event\-based?
.sp
The IRC protocol itself is asynchronous and server\-driven. For you, this means the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
For any IRC command, it is not possible to obtain an immediate response whether the command succeed
or not. Instead the server will send the reply in a short (or long) period of time.
.IP \(bu 2
For some IRC command there is no ‘success’ response at all. For example, when you send a text
message, IRC server will not send anything to confirm that the message is already sent.
.IP \(bu 2
You can send several commands to the IRC server, and then receive several replies regarding every
command. The order of the replies you receive is generally undefined.
.IP \(bu 2
A lot of IRC events sent to you is generated by other users, or the IRC server itself, and are
sent to you just when they are generated.
.IP \(bu 2
Long lists (for example, channel lists) are also sent as events. Moreover, these events could be
separated by other events (message or notices). And it is your responsibility to separate the data
(using event codes), and use some sort of data structure that will hold it until the data is complete.
It is not possible to simply query the list of channels, and expect that its content will immediately arrive.
.IP \(bu 2
You may send the request, and not receive a response in case of success (such as when you send a message).
You may send the request and it will only succeed when you receive a response (which may be after you receive
ten more unrelated events). Or you can receive a response without even sending a request, as it is the case
with JOIN \- it is possible for the server to JOIN you to a specific channel implicitly.
.IP \(bu 2
You should be prepared to expect the unexpected from the IRC server. For example, the server can change your
nick (seen on most servers, which use nickserv authentication. You can be “forced” to join the channel, to
say something, to leave a channel, to change your usermode and so on. Listen what IRC server tells you, and do so.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Why the irc_cmd_join function does not return an error?
.sp
A typical example is the \fBirc_cmd_join()\fP call always returns success even when you attempt to join a password\-protected
channel. Then some time later the IRC server returns an error. This is because the irc_cmd family of functions return
success when the command is sent to the IRC server. The asynchronous nature of IRC makes it impossible to obtain the
command result immediately. Please read the question above.
.SS How to register/auth with NICKSERV?
.sp
There is no ‘standard’ way. NICKSERV, CHANSERV and so on are not specified by the RFC. They are IRC extensions which
behave exactly like the other IRC users but with more power. Typically their messages are sent via Notice events, so
you can use following algorithm to handle Nickserv registration:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
static void event_notice (irc_session_t * session, const char * event,
                                                 const char * origin, const char ** params, unsigned int count)
{
        char buf[256];

        if ( !origin )
                return;

        if ( strcasecmp (origin, "nickserv") )
                return;

        if ( strstr (params[1], "This nick is not registered") == params[1] )
        {
                sprintf (buf, "REGISTER %s NOMAIL", gCfg.irc_nickserv_password);
                irc_cmd_msg(session, "nickserv", buf);
        }
        else if ( strstr (params[1], "This nickname is registered and protected") == params[1] )
        {
                sprintf (buf, "IDENTIFY %s", gCfg.irc_nickserv_password);
                irc_cmd_msg(session, "nickserv", buf);
        }
        else if ( strstr (params[1], "Password accepted \- you are now recognized") == params[1] )
                printf ("Nickserv authentication succeed.");
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The idea is to parse the messages sent from NICKSERV, and if they’re matched the specific patterns, react on them appropriately.
.SS What is CTCP?
.sp
CTCP abbreviature is deciphered as “Client\-to\-Client Protocol”. It is used between the IRC clients to query the
remote client for some data, or to send some information – for example, /me messages are sent via CTCP.
.sp
There is no standard list of possible CTCP requests, and different IRC clients often add their own CTCP codes.
The built\-in handler reacts on TIME, VERSION, PING and FINGER CTCP queries. If you need to react on other requests,
you’ll have to write your own CTCP handler. See the source code of libirc_event_ctcp_internal function to get an
idea how to write it.
.SS When I am made a chanop (+o) why do I not receive the event_umode?
.sp
Becoming a channel operator channes the \fBchannel mode\fP, not user mode. Therefore you will receive \fBevent_mode\fP and not \fBevent_umode\fP
.sp
If you receive the event_umode with +o this means your user is an IRC server operator.
.SS What if my application uses epoll?
.sp
The library only directly supports the select()\-based loops for historic reasons, so epoll and other polling methods are not supported directly by the library.
However but if necessart, it could be emulated by converting descriptors between select and epoll as following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Call irc_add_select_descriptors with an empty FD_SET
.IP \(bu 2
Extract the descriptors from the fd_set arrays (remember fd_array is a bitarray, not the value array). There may be more than one descriptor in case there are DCC sessions.
.IP \(bu 2
Pass those descriptors to poll/epoll using relevant events (i.e. use the EPOLLIN for the descriptors in the \fIin_set\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
For those descriptors which triggered the events, fill up the relevant in_set and out_set structures (again, remember the bitmasks!) and pass them to \fBirc_process_select_descriptors()\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
While this is cumbersome, the operations are very simple (basically bitmask operations on a small structure) and will not add any significant slowdown to your application.
