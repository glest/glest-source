Building from source

The library uses autoconf so it is build in a fairly typical way on most Unix systems:

./configure
make
This will build both the library and various examples in the examples subdirectory.

Configure script also accepts parameters, optional useful parameters accepted are –enable-openssl and –enable-ipv6 which correspondingly enable the SSL and IPv6 connectivity. Use –enable-shared to build a shared library.

The same procedure is used to build the Win32 binary using the MinGW compiler.

For the rest see the Doxygen documentation in the header files and http://www.ulduzsoft.com/libircclient/
