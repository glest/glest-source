# WEBSITE DESIGN

## Unit Documentation

### https://glest.github.io/

The repo is at https://github.com/Glest/glest.github.io

#### Files in the root folder

Files are published to the web site automatically when the repo is updated.

The style sheet is in [media](https://github.com/Glest/glest.github.io/tree/master/convert_faction_xml2html/media)

And it's copied to the root folder of the website when the
[perl script](https://github.com/Glest/glest.github.io/blob/master/convert_faction_xml2html/convert_faction_xml2html.pl)
is run. The script generates the html (which is how you'd preview your
changes).

Part of the template for the site is in the perl script, and another part is in
[an ini file](https://github.com/Glest/glest.github.io/blob/master/convert_faction_xml2html/glestpack.ini).

## Primary documentation

### Files in [docs](https://github.com/Glest/glest.github.io/tree/master/docs)

See the [README in that folder](https://github.com/Glest/glest.github.io/blob/master/docs/README.md)
for an explanation of how to edit the html files in glest.github.io/docs.
