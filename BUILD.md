# BUILD.md

## Set up the repositories locally

If you would like to contribute to development, you will need to
**fork** and then **clone your forks** of these 2 repositories:

* https://github.com/ZetaGlest/zetaglest-source
* https://github.com/ZetaGlest/zetaglest-data

### Procedure for cloning your forks

1. Create a new directory to clone your **zetaglest-source** and
**zetaglest-data** into e.g. call it `ZetaGlest`.

2. Enter (or 'cd') into the new directory (`ZetaGlest` in the example).

3. clone **zetaglest-source** and **zetaglest-data** using the clone
info provided by your fork. (Use the "Clone or Download" link, but
**do** select `clone` **not** `Download Zip`.) Make sure the cloned
repo directories are in the same directory, adjacent to each other (and
**not** in a subdirectory).

### Note

If you have cloned the repositories this way, do not use the
`git_update.sh` provided in the source directory. See
[syncing](https://github.com/ZetaGlest/zetaglest-source/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md#syncing)
for information on how to sync your repo with the main upstream (no,
you can't juse use **_merge_**).

## Dependencies

### Linux

On Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Opensuse and even more Linux distributions,
after you clone the source repository, you may use

    cd mk/linux
    sudo ./setupBuildDeps.sh

which will run your package manager and attempt to install the needed packages.

On Windows simply run `setup.bat` in `\mk\windows`.

(These may vary based on your operating system or Linux distribution;
we will attempt to document dependencies in more detail)

Below is a list of most dependencies you will need. This document needs
to indicate better which are optional and which are required.

gcc g++ cmake libsdl2-dev libalut-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libvorbis-dev
 libx11-dev liblua5.2-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libircclient-dev
 libglew-dev libftgl-dev libfribidi-dev libcppunit-dev libminiupnpc-dev libfreetype6-dev
libgnutls28-dev libkrb5-dev libkrb5-dev libnghttp2-dev libopenal-dev libldap2-dev
libwxgtk3.0-dev librtmp-dev libvlccore-dev libvlc-dev

Additionally for map editor and model viewer:

libwxgtk3.0-dev libxml2-dev

### Mac OS X

(Needs editing/updating)
[Current Status](https://github.com/ZetaGlest/zetaglest-source/issues/25)

### Windows

Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/ZetaGlest/zetaglest-source/blob/develop/mk/windows/README.md) listed in the `Windows` directory.

### OpenBSD

Below is a list of most of dependencies you will need.

cmake libvorbis lua sdl2 openal wxWidgets fribidi ftgl nghttp2 gnutls glew jpeg png
miniupnpc curl freeealut

A C++11 compiler is mandatory, so base (or package) clang++, or eg++ (from 4.9.3)

You can install the dependencies using `pkg_add`:

`pkg_add curl libvorbis openal sdl2 git miniupnpc cmake wxWidgets
xerces-c lua icu4c freealut`

#### Optional

`pkg_add g++ (either 4.9.3 or 6.2.0)`

### Arch Linux

You can install the dependencies using `pacman`:

`pacman -S curl ftgl glew glu icu libgl libircclient libvorbis libx11
lua51 miniupnpc openal sdl2 wxgtk3 xerces-c cmake ftjam git mesa`

## Compiling

### Linux and Mac OS X

#### build and run without installing

From the top of the project source directory:

    mk build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=""
    make
    make install (copies 3 required files)

The zetaglest binaries will be in the `build/` directory. Run
'./zetaglest' to start the game.

#### build and install

From the top of the project source directory:

    mk build
    cd build

**Note:** Using the paths specified below, you will need super-user
privileges when you run `make install`.

    cmake .. \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr \
    -DZETAGLEST_DATA_INSTALL_PATH=share/games/zetaglest \
    -DZETAGLEST_BIN_INSTALL_PATH=games

    make install

**Note:** The majority of the game data is not installed during the
steps above.

#### Uninstalling

Makefiles generated with cmake do not have an 'uninstall' option. There
is a [discussion at this
link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41471620/cmake-support-make-uninstall)
on how to do that.

Instead of using `make install`, you may wish to install from a
specific distribution package. Later, you could uninstall using your package
manager.

**Note:** Installation is not necessary to run the game.

### Windows

    ./build-zg.bat

### OpenBSD

From the top of the project source directory:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=eg++ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=""
    make
    make install (copies 3 required files)

The zetaglest binaries will be in the `build/` directory. Run
'./zetaglest' to start the game.
